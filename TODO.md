1. Get map title (m_title) and if it's ranked
2. Check if every player is a hero with m_programId (players can be observers) -> `'m_toon': {'m_id': 10798147, 'm_programId': b'Hero', 'm_realm': 1, 'm_region': 1},`

For the below: check if player is on database

3. Get player win-rate overall (pandas)
4. Get player win-rate with one particular hero (pandas)
5. Get player win-rate on one particular map (pandas)
6. easy "sugested ban" for each player (maybe top 3)
